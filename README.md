# SVGA v3

A framework for making interactive animations with SVG.

* [Wiki](https://github.com/cdig/svga/wiki)
* [Issues](https://github.com/cdig/svga/issues)
* [Starter Project](https://github.com/cdig/svg-activity-starter)

Todo:
* drag controls with 4-way arrow in outside corner
* Control: vertical divider (only shows in horizontal)
* Control: N-state toggle
* Schematic button
* labels above controls

Carl Requested:
* Background Color
* Floating Mimic
* Pause
* Dynamic Drawing

Can come later:
* BOM/POI (because those are "large schematic" features)
* Picture-to-Symbol (because that's painful to implement)
* Voiceover/Lessons
