# SVG Activity Components
A framework for making activities/animations with SVGs. If looking to build an SVG Activity, please look at the [SVG Activity Starter](https://github.com/cdig/svg-activity-starter)

Getting Started, Troubleshooting, and other documentation has been moved to the Wiki, under SVG Activity in the sidebar: https://github.com/cdig/lunchboxsessions/wiki


## TODO

TopBar & ControlPanel
* Menu should figure out when the content is standalone and hide itself
* POIs should be pins in the schematic. Tap and it'll nav you to that area.
* Arrows & Pause should go in the control panel, because they're only useful when the animation is running
* Labels — might be able to tuck this into a settings menu (with BG color)?
* But how do we do settings?
* Help — don't need it if we kill all the other buttons
* Mimic should be a picture-in-picture that sits in one of the 4 corners

* Set the startTime for animations inside the first tick, so we start at 0. This avoids a judder when an animation starts.
